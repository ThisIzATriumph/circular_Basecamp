What is said in the wasteland sums up the whole issue of the garden or the landscape: movement. To ignore this movement is not only to consider the plant as a finished object but also to isolate it historically and biologically from the context that makes it exist. This inevitably leads to plastic use of the "alibi" type. Time eats away at the alibis: like that, there are sections of walls and rows of trees clinging to the landscape in a somewhat desperate way, just to alert a memory, question an emotion, solicit a nostalgia. I like wasteland because it doesn't refer to anything that perishes. In bed, species indulge in invention. The walk in wasteland is a perpetual questioning because everything is done there to thwart the most adventurous speculations. "
