# The Circular Basecamp

<SimpleCard width="700px">

Imagine a future in which the Circular Economy has reached its full potential. What could it look like? 

Is it a world where energy became scarce, forcing us to tune down our train of lives and relying on frugal innovations? Is it a balanced version of our current global economy in which consumerism has been leashed, fostering reuse, repair & remanufacturing? Is it only "recycling on steroids"? 

Alternatively, can we really consider that an economic paradigm such as the Circular Economy ever reaches "its full potential"? Should we consider that our current global consumerist economy has reached its full potential? 

An economy is the answer to 3 questions: 
- What to produce?
- Who produces it?
- Who reaps the benefits of it?

It also consists in the observation of 3 types of flow: 
- The flow of materials 
- The flow of people
- The flow of information 

Being reliant on flows, an economy is more fluctant than static. It changes constantly, dynamically. In that case, asking whether the Circular Economy will ever reach its full potential is the wrong question. 

More accurately, we should ask ourselves about the peaks of the Circular Economy. What are the practical applications that fall under the definition of a Circular Economy & how do we reach them? 

### The Basecamp

Circular Basecamp is just about that, to help the practioners of the Circular Economy in envisioning the "Circular peaks" to conquer and to give the tools needed to start the hikes.

#### Gear up

A basecamp is just the first step to a much longer hike, though it hikers will get supplies & gear up for the challenges ahead. This website contains entry level explainations about Circular Design and thoughts on the Circular Economy. It can serve as a first step in the ascension of the peaks that are fully deployed "product-service-systems". 

#### Learn along the Hike 

Reaching the Basecamp is just one step in the ascension, as a systemic practice Circular Design is best learnt on the job. The Basecamp doesn't replaces the hike! 

#### Share weight & utilities 

Climbing Circular peaks doesn't have to be done alone however. Pioneers and practitioners can share weight & utilities and as such, the Circular transition must be done collectively.
