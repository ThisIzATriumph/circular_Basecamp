# The Circular Basecamp

<SimpleCard width="700px">

<p>
Base camp *noun* :

A main encampment providing supplies, shelter, and communications for persons engaged in wide-ranging activities, as exploring, reconnaissance, hunting, or mountain climbing.</p>

Imagine a future in which the Circular Economy has reached its full potential. What could it look like? 

Would it be a world where energy became scarce, forcing us to tune down our train of lives and relying on frugal innovations? Would it be a balanced version of our current global economy in which consumerism has been leashed, fostering reuse, repair & remanufacturing? Would it only be "recycling on steroids"? 

Looking more closely, can we really consider that an economic paradigm such as the Circular Economy ever reaches "its full potential"? Should we even consider that our current global consumerist economy has reached its full potential? 

An economy asks 3 questions: 
- What to produce?
- How to produce it?
- Who gets the benefits?

It also has 3 main components': 
- The flows of materials 
- The flows of energy
- The flows of information (particularly money)

Being reliant on flows, an economy is more fluctant than static. It changes constantly, dynamically. Following this train of thoughts, asking whether the Circular Economy will ever reach its full potential is the going in the wrong direction. 

More accurately, we should ask ourselves about the **peaks of the Circular Economy**:
What are the practical applications; the achievements that fall under the definition of the Circular Economy & on top of these ... how do we reach them? 

### The Basecamp

Circular Basecamp is just about that, helping the practioners of the Circular Economy to envision the "Circular peaks" to conquer and to give the tools needed to start their hikes.

#### Circular peaks

If achieving the Circular Economy is all about the hikes, what are the "Circular Peaks"? Those are all the examples of "Product-service-systems" already up and running, forming what we could already call a Circular Economy. For example, the car pooling system Blablacar could already be seen as a Circular proposition: Intensifying the usage of cars through multiple uses and decreasing needs for new vehicles. 

#### Gearing up

A basecamp is just the first step to a much longer hike through it, hikers will get supplies & gear up for the challenges ahead. This website contains entry level explainations about Circular Design and thoughts on the Circular Economy. It can serve as a first step in the ascension of the peaks that are fully deployed "product-service-systems". Starting to gear up passes by a good backpack, don't hesitate to check the <a href="/growing-your-backpack">"Growing your backpack"</a> entry on that regard. 

#### Learn along the Hike 

Reaching the Basecamp is just one step in the ascension, as a systemic practice Circular Design is best learnt on the job. The Basecamp doesn't replaces the hike! 

#### Share weight & utilities 

Climbing Circular peaks doesn't have to be done alone however. Pioneers and practitioners can share weight & utilities and as such, the Circular transition must be done collectively.

This website is split into 4 sections, all working parts of a functional basecamp. 
* First in line is **the digital garden**, a collection of thoughts more or less closely related to the Circular Economy. 
* Then come **the peaks** (you're seeing one of them now), those are more structured essays meant to be sharing an opinion about the Circular Economy
* **Illustration & Sketchnotes** come in third, crowdlearning the Circular economy is done through stories and visuals are the best supports to convey them.
* Finally the **library** is just what it sounds like, a collection of reads that connect to our topic. If you go there, be sure to check the **Anti-library** of books that I would love to read, one day, maybe. 

#### Dive in

Not sure where to start? <a href="/circular-economy-101">"Circular economy 101"</a> is there for you, enjoy your reading and make sure to reach out if you want to discuss. 

Enjoy the hikes,
