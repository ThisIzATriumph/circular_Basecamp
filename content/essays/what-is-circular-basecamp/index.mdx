 **A key insight
preached in Carpenter’s book is the need to involve those
who are affected by a new work procedure in the design of
that procedure. His staff wrote 98 percent of the procedures
currently in place and had a “heavy hand” in shaping the remaining
2 percent that Carpenter created himself.** As a result,
his employees are “fully vested” in these processes. Perhaps
even more crucial, Carpenter made it easy to instigate
further improvements. “If an employee has a good idea
for improving a procedure, we will make an instant modification—
with no bureaucratic hang-ups,” he explains.  He
takes this employee involvement so seriously that he now requires
his service representatives to submit at least a dozen
proposed improvements before they qualify to receive their
annual performance bonus.
