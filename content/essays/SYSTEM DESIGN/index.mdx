## II. SYSTEM DESIGN

Pretty counter-intuitive for a website that pretends teaching about the basics of the Circular Economy isn't it? 

Fret not, you won't be alone in the path that leads to Circular mastery. The thing is, at this point in time, the jobs of the Circular Economy are still to be defined. For that reason every practitioner can discover for herself the niche that will fit her, being the execution of a Circular design to the envisioning of a Circular future and its metricization or a combination of these different topics. 

This is why, the Circular Education is a "do it yourself" practice. One will hardly find a unique source to tell them everthing about Circularity. Good sources exists, that is certain. But in the end, Circularity is a taste to pre-existing expertises and the new flavors of jobs it creates are yet to be fully discovered. This also makes the discipline highly exciting to explore!

As for relevant sources, here are a few as a starter: 
- <a href="https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/topics/circular-economy-introduction/overview"> Introduction to the CE by the Ellen MacArthur foundation </a>
- Source 2 
- Source 3

## Let's discuss about it 

As an ever-defining systemic practice, Circularity is best learnt together. The topic is so bushy that it needs a concerto of many minds to discover its best practices. Therefore the crowdlearning. 

Learners need to wrap their head around the niches defined by their expertises and come back to each other to "sharpen the saw". They will need debates, allnighter discussions & slick keynotes to do so.

## Here are a few hints

Further down the line, Circularity is close to a life philosophy. One of lesser consumption through Reuse, Repair, Refurbish, Remanufacture & Recycle. It is the promess of a regenerative future and the opportunity to find beauty in frugal innovations. It's also a slap in the face, a lesson of humility from the complexity of the society we, sapiens, created. 

The Circular Basecamp is also compiling thoughts on this life philosophy, of Circularity and the transition towards Circularity (the peaks and the hikes), as an ever-lasting quest which, eventually is what being human is about.

Take a look at the following thoughts from the garden to give you an idea:
