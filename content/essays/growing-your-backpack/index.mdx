To the usual image of the tree of knowledge, should we not prefer that of a complex and multiple ecosystem such as a forest?

Can you create an empty board that people can replicate to start leaning by themselves?

### The Backpack
Practicing circular design takes some training, as a systemic discipline it requires a defined set of skills and a less-defined body of knowledge. If the Circular designer is the hiker ascending the mounts of the Circular Economy, the set of skills and knowledge he or she acquired constitute the hiking backpack.

#### Crafting one's backpack 

There is something very powerful about using the backpack analogy, as for one's regular backpack we wouldn't think about going off to a hike without preparing it ourselves. Packing for a trip is very personal and could be seen as one of the first step of the trip itself. 

The same goes for crafting one's skills and knowledge about Circular Design. We can be taught about it, but it is important to make it out own. More particularly, the skills of Circular Design are close from the ones of any industrial designer or engineer. The broader knowledge about Sustainability and the Circular Economy is proteiform. Each practitioner needs to wrestle with it by him or herself. To create his or her own picture of the field. 

Backpack crafting can be overwhelming with no prior experience. Which materials to choose? What to pack, what to leave off? What will be enough and what is too much? 
The same overwhelm applied to learning Circular design and Sustainability in general: there is a lot. From Emotional design to Climate change, every bit of knowledge connects to a broader understanding of the field but the beginner is left off with indecision: where do I start? What is the most important right now? 

We find here the primary aim of this website, welcoming Circular hikers and hearing them up for their first ascensions. The Circular Basecamp cuts the indecision and offers a place to start, it does that through visualization and crowdlearning.

 **A key insight
preached in Carpenter’s book is the need to involve those
who are affected by a new work procedure in the design of
that procedure. His staff wrote 98 percent of the procedures
currently in place and had a “heavy hand” in shaping the remaining
2 percent that Carpenter created himself.** As a result,
his employees are “fully vested” in these processes. Perhaps
even more crucial, Carpenter made it easy to instigate
further improvements. “If an employee has a good idea
for improving a procedure, we will make an instant modification—
with no bureaucratic hang-ups,” he explains.  He
takes this employee involvement so seriously that he now requires
his service representatives to submit at least a dozen
proposed improvements before they qualify to receive their
annual performance bonus.

<p  style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}> "To extend this reasoning, my friend Jack Hicks from
English department and I were talking about the possibility
to see the university as a natural system and we
d emandions what the information flow would look like. We
we found ourselves, in this year of awareness of the
forest, to remind us of the ancient links that schools had with groves. In China too, schools like
the Han-lin were called "groves". N or s considerion s that the
information network of the modern learning institution,
to building habitats, has a flow of energy supplied
through the accumulation of data from the first workers in
the news channel - especially third-year students
cycle and intellectuals. Some are green like grass, some
basic photosynthesizers, grazing on very new materials. Others get caught up in the cycle of rubbish and tunnel huge logs of old science, philosophies
and literatures that have been left on the ground in the past, and the
demolish through fungal networks to convert them to
new in edible forms. These people who are
on the ground of the information forest are among the largest
workers and there is no doubt that they are sometimes scared
by the hawkish shadows that sail above them.
The collected nutrients are stored in a place
called the bibliotek, "the place of the papyrus", or the library, "the place
bark ”, because the Latin word for tree bark and book
is the same, which refers to the first fiber used for
write in this part of the Mediterranean.
If you allow me to continue this happy ecological analogy, we could say that the essays, the reports
techniques and articles that early workers wrote
are in a sense swallowed up by researchers and condensed into
conclusions and theories - new studies, which in turn
move along the information chain to thinkers at the
top of it and which, after having digested them, derive
unified theories or maybe a new paradigm. These texts
final, built from the assembled information concentrate
further down the chain, will be seen as noble monarchs
of the university forest. Such giants must sometimes succumb and regain contact with the forest floor.
To the question "What is above the chain?
of information? », We may be tempted to answer that these are
artists and writers, because they are among the predators
into the most effective and ruthless information. They
are light and mobile and can melt off the top of any
disciplines and run with what they think is the best of
each of them to convert them into novels, mythologies, dense and esoteric essays, arts (visual or other),
or in poems. And who eat artists and writers? The
answer is they have to be, ultimately, recycled
by beginners, students. This is where artists and writers go, to be happily nibbled on and transferred. The
library itself forms the heart of this ancient forest.
