<p  style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}> "It was the language of nature (natural topography), and not the standard of human language, that dictated the city plan. You can feel it in Tokyo today; at least in Yamanote, because in Shitamachi the height of the contemporary frame has largely obliterated the natural landmarks.

What is more, this topographical reference to nature is coupled with an ecological reference and a religious reference.

Ecological, because the slopes and embankments so numerous of Tokyo often keep a semi-wild vegetation; it is the principle of interstices.

Religious, because these intersections originally correspond to limits or to liminal zones, as such impregnated with coronation. Proof of the many sanctuaries that have been established there. These places of worship are often only modest oratories, dedicated to a genius of limits. Almost everywhere in Japanese cities, near bridges, coirements, branches or sides, we find these small altars, raised to various deities: Inari, Jizo, Dosojin etc. Sometimes also the introductory area is large enough to accommodate a real temple, Shintoic sanctuary or Buddhist monastery, surrounded by large trees and very often close to a drop. [...]

The principle of the gap still works in the play of facades. Not terraced, as in any Japanese city, these traditionally are slim and light. It completely stops neither sounds nor glances; formerly, many facades even included laths. The separating effect, between house and street, is obtained by the superposition of several planes, rather than by means of a wall endowed with an intrinsic thickness and plasticity. The depth effect comes from axis setbacks which require translations parallel to the main planes. The git the principle of prevention, this game of screens whose ambiguous function is to hide and to discover at the same time.

Now, what can be glimpsed by the intervals of these planes? Nature again; because these interestsices of the cultural order relate to the natural order: "they belong not to the order of man, but to that of nature." For example, in the Japanese house, the man is reluctant to completely obliterate the ground underlying the floor. Thanks to the use of stilts, the earth continues to breathe under the house ...

The architecture of the Japanese city thus leaves, through multiple faults, the springing of nature within the human work."
