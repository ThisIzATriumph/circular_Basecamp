### Complicated vs Complex

Complex is used to refer to the level of components in a system. If a problem is complex, it means that it has many components. Complexity does not evoke difficulty.

On the other hand, complicated refers to a high level of difficulty. If a problem is complicated, there might be or might not be many parts but it will certainly take a lot of hard work to solve. <Footnote idName={1}>From : https://english.stackexchange.com/a/10461 </Footnote> 



### Is the world magical?

*"Forest spirit, miracles, mysteries ... For many human communities, the world is magical - if only because the experience is full of unexplained phenomena.*

*One of the main postulates of modern science is, on the contrary, that nature is devoid of mystery, and that all that is natural is understandable, and will one day be understood.*

*By revealing the complexity of earthly life on all scales, ecology again legitimizes the question of the magic of the world."* <Footnote idName={1}>Wildproject, *Thoughts of Ecology* (2021) </Footnote>
