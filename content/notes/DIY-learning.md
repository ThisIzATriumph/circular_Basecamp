#### Cal Newport - A world without emails - *p125*
 **A key insight preached in Carpenter’s book is the need to involve those who are affected by a new work procedure in the design of that procedure. His staff wrote 98 percent of the procedures currently in place and had a “heavy hand” in shaping the remaining 2 percent that Carpenter created himself.** 

As a result, his employees are “fully vested” in these processes. Perhaps even more crucial, Carpenter made it easy to instigate further improvements. “If an employee has a good idea for improving a procedure, we will make an instant modification— with no bureaucratic hang-ups,” he explains.  He takes this employee involvement so seriously that he now requires his service representatives to submit at least a dozen proposed improvements before they qualify to receive their annual performance bonus.
