### It's more complex than we think - Breaking oppositions between nature & society 

<Draft />

One of the most entrenched ideas in Western thought is the notion that nature is a harsh realm of necessity, a domain of unrelenting lawfulness and compulsion. From this underlying idea, two extreme attitudes have emerged. Either humanity must yield with religious or "ecological" humility to the dictat of natural law" and take its abject place side by side with the lowly ants on which it "arrogantly" treads, or it must "conquer" nature by means of its technological and rational astuteness, in a shared project ultimately to "liberate" all of humanity from the compulsion of natural "necessity" -an enterprise that may well entail the subjugation of human by human.

There must be another position than a simple dualism, "to rule or to be ruled".

<br />
The first attitude, a quasi-religious quietism, is typified by <a href="/deep-ecology">"Deep ecology"</a>, antihumanism, and sociobiology, while the second, an activist approach, is typified by the liberal and Marxian image of an omniscient humanity cast in a commandeering posture toward the natural world. Modern science-despite its claims to value -free objectivity- unwittingly takes on an ethical mantle when it commits itself to a concept of nature as comprehensible, as orderly in the sense that nature's "laws'" are rationally explicable and basically necessitarian. The ancient Greeks viewed this orderly structure of the natural world as evidence of a cosmic *nous* or *logos* that produced a subjective presence in natural phenomena as a whole. Yet with only a minimal shift in emphasis, this same notion of an orderly nature can yield the dismal conclusion that "freedom is the recognition of necessity'" (to use Friedrich Engels's rephrasing of Hegel's definition). In this latter case, freedom is subtly turned into its opposite: the mere consciousness of what we can or cannot do.

Sustainability's triple bottom line: Society, Ecology, Economy starts with the people. A sustainable transition will be social or won't be. 

<SimpleCard width="700px">

<p  style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}> The power of social ecology lies in the association it establishes between society and ecology, in understanding that the social is, potentially at least, a fulfillment of the latent dimension of freedom in nature, and that the ecological is a major organizing principle of social development. In short, social ecology advances the guidelines for an ecological society. The great divorce between nature and society - between the "biological" and the "cultural" - is overcome by shared developmental concepts such as greater diversity in evolution; the wider and more complete participation of all components in a whole; and the ever more fecund potentialities that expand the horizon of freedom and reflexivity. Society, like mind, ceases to be "sui generis". Like mind, with its natural history, social life emerges from the loosely banded animal community to form the highly institutionalized human community.
