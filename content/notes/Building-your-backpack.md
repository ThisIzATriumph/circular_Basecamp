Learn to build your own Personal Knowledge Base! (Miro)
Can you create an empty board that people can replicate to start leaning by themselves?

### The Backpack
Practicing circular design takes some training, as a systemic discipline it requires a defined set of skills and a less-defined body of knowledge. If the Circular designer is the hiker ascending the mounts of the Circular Economy, the set of skills and knowledge he or she acquired constitute the hiking backpack. 

#### Crafting one's backpack 

There is something very powerful about using the backpack analogy, as for one's regular backpack we wouldn't think about going off to a hike without preparing it ourselves. Packing for a trip is very personal and could be seen as one of the first step of the trip itself. 

The same goes for crafting one's skills and knowledge about Circular Design. We can be taught about it, but it is important to make it out own. More particularly, the skills of Circular Design are close from the ones of any industrial designer or engineer. The broader knowledge about Sustainability and the Circular Economy is proteiform. Each practitioner needs to wrestle with it by him or herself. To create his or her own picture of the field. 

Backpack crafting can be overwhelming with no prior experience. Which materials to choose? What to pack, what to leave off? What will be enough and what is too much? 
The same overwhelm applied to learning Circular design and Sustainability in general: there is a lot. From Emotional design to Climate change, every bit of knowledge connects to a broader understanding of the field but the beginner is left off with indecision: where do I start? What is the most important right now? 

We find here the primary aim of this website, welcoming Circular hikers and hearing them up for their first ascensions. The Circular Basecamp cuts the indecision and offers a place to start, it does that through visualization and crowdlearning.

 **A key insight
preached in Carpenter’s book is the need to involve those
who are affected by a new work procedure in the design of
that procedure. His staff wrote 98 percent of the procedures
currently in place and had a “heavy hand” in shaping the remaining
2 percent that Carpenter created himself.** As a result,
his employees are “fully vested” in these processes. Perhaps
even more crucial, Carpenter made it easy to instigate
further improvements. “If an employee has a good idea
for improving a procedure, we will make an instant modification—
with no bureaucratic hang-ups,” he explains.  He
takes this employee involvement so seriously that he now requires
his service representatives to submit at least a dozen
proposed improvements before they qualify to receive their
annual performance bonus.
