### The Crafts(wo)man-Explorer. 

Craftsmanship and exploration are two faces of the same coin.

#### Curiosity-led activities 
Craft(wo)manship and exploration are both curiosity-led activities. They derive from the eagerness to know more and the love of the discovery process. 

1. Eagerness to know more: Building resilience
	Humans have a constant **willingness to be more prepared**, to get themselves ready for the unknown. This translates into a natural curiosity for what is unknown and a will to progress. (We've treated the idea of progress & development in the essay about antifragile-circularity, check it out!)
	
2. Discovery process
	Through curiosity, there is also a real interest in the act of discovering something unknown, that is **in the process of discovering itself**. Who never heard that the path is more important than the destination? 
	
#### We find these two axis into Craftmanship & Exploration

The good craft(wo)man is practicing its art while getting better at it. He or she is constantly mapping the boudaries of its skills, pushing to achieve a "better" craft.

The good explorer is also pushing boudaries, those being physical or mental through the understanding of a certain culture or civilization. 

### Circular Economy is offering new boudaries 

The circular economy is offering an horizon as a society where waste doesn't exist. Instead of seeing it as a challenge, we can choose to see it as a frontier to discover, a boudary to push. 

Why not being curious about the application of the Circular Economy? 

This pushes us away from the doom & gloom scenarios of global collapse and further into the action.
