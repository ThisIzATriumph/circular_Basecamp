Donella Meadows coined the expression of 'Dancing with systems' for the practitioners of Systems thinking. The systems thinkers & designers who would know and respect the complexity lying before them. 

### Humbling experience
As pointed by Joel de Rosnay in its book "The Macroscope" (see it in the library), the first step to any work with a system is to understand that we are an integral part of one of its supra-system. We are the cell observing the human body. 

Realize that it is much too complex for you.
Realize that you need to learn
Realize that by learning, you're modifying yourself and therefore the system

### Lifelong learners

As pointed in the [[craftsman-explorer]] seed, the application of the Circular Economy is still to be discovered in its many ways. This requires us to be attuned to the new ways of implementing it. There won't be a single way of circular living. 

For that reasons, system dancers will need to remain lifelong learners and take with them this lesson of humility in every milestone of their journey. 

### The art of learning together: Crowdlearning

Yet lifelong learning doesn't have to be a lonely path. Even more so, as deploying a circular system can't be done by a single Circular designer: Learning to dance with circular systems is a collective process. We call it crowdlearning. 

Crowdlearning is the collaborative practice that leads to a finer understanding of, in our case, Circularity.

### Good systems dancers are good humans
As mentioned above, learning to be a good systems dancer is a collaborative practice. Therefore we can argue that good learners are the ones able to collaborate best with their peers. 

This requires a personal balance and means to approach one-another in a non-violent way. We therefore have a lot to learn from forms of non-violent communications and collective intelligence practices. 

### Living your humanity
In the end, the process itself of learning to become systems dancers is what we would like to call living our humanity. There is a great dynamic in learning together while at the same time applying our knowledge to ourselves and the systems that surrounds us.
