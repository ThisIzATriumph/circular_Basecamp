Donella Meadows coined the expression of 'Dancing with systems' for the practitioners of Systems thinking. The systems thinkers & designers who would know and respect the complexity lying before them. 

### Humbling experience
As pointed by Joel de Rosnay in its book "The Macroscope" (see it in the library), the first step to any work with a system is to understand that we are an integral part of one of its supra-system. We are the cell observing the human body. 

Realize that it is much too complex for you.
Realize that you need to learn
Realize that by learning, you're modifying yourself and therefore the system

### Lifelong learners
