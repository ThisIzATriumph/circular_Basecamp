Donella Meadows coined the expression of 'Dancing with systems' for the practitioners of Systems thinking. The systems thinkers & designers who would know and respect the complexity lying before them. 

### Humbling experience
As pointed by Joel de Rosnay in its book "The Macroscope" (see it in the library), the first step to any work with a system is to understand that we are an integral part of one of its supra-system. We are the cell observing the human body. 


### Good systems dancers are good humans


### Living your humanity
