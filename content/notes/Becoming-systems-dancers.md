Donella Meadows coined the expression of 'Dancing with systems' for the practitioners of Systems thinking. The systems thinkers & designers who would know and respect the complexity lying before them. 

As mentioned in other posts, practicing circularity or circular design is for me a dance with systems. 

Humbling experience, 

Good systems dancers are good humans.

Living your humanity
