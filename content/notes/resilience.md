### Improving your own resilience

Hegel 'justifying" private property:
<SimpleCard width="700px">

<p  style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}> A person has the right to put his will into absolutely anything and thereby make it his own, for this thing has no end in itself and derives its destiny and its soul from its own will. Such is the absolute right of appropriation that man has over all "things". </p>

</SimpleCard>

What in ourselves, gives this desire, not only to satisfy our basic biological needs but also to extend our will over things, to objectify them, to make them ours, to manipulate them? Is this really a rational desire?
