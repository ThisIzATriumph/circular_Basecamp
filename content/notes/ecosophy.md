Art, happiness, consciousness, duty, State, inconsciousness, justice, language, freedom, nature, reason, religion, science, technique, time, work & truth. Those are the 17 topics through which Philosophy is taught in French high-schools. 

In those teachings Ecology is either forgotten or treated as a niche, part of the notion of Nature. 

Ecology however, has a lot to bring to classical Phylosophy. It can invest & modify the meaning of well established notions such as life, societies, relationships & nature. It can also bring new ones to light such as ecosystems, Gaia, disaster & care etc. 

Ecosophy is this result.

Arne Naess, deep ecology and ecosophy. 

What ecology brings to philosophy. (end or the ecology book)

### The cult of reason 

#### The one equation 

Trying to summarize the whole universe with one single equation. 

### Intuition-backed reason

#### Complex systems design is timely 

An entire analysis takes a lot of time and can easily be criticized. 

Instead we propose to reason in order of scales backed up by intuition. 

#### Sustainability at scales through circular design 
Achieve sustainability in order of scales, f.e. we know that a certain change in the system will lead to waste reduction. We choose to implement it. 

How do we make sure we don't produce negative externalities on the other side of the system?
